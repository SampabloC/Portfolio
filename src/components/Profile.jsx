            I'm a passionate technology seeker, someone who likes to solve logical problems and is always looking to provide the best solution. <br />
            I enjoy continuously improving my skills, not only in coding but also in other areas, such as enhancing my soft skills. <br />
            I always strive to give my best and provide an optimal solution to each problem, applying all the best practices in my code. <br />
            Apart from coding, I'm a big fan of my Volkswagen and my dogs, so when I'm not coding, I'm working on my car or taking care of my dogs.<br />
